# Binary classification clients in R

In this project, I will build binary classification models that classify the clients according to the credit quality (ability to repay a credit loan in according to the contractual terms). We will build Logistic Regression,Lasso (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) Regression,Decision Tree,Random Forest and LDA (Linear discriminant analysis) models and compare them according to the cost and accuracy.

Please check the documents and code for further details.
